ndrive manual
=============

Introduction
------------

*ndrive* is a python library that can provide an access to Naver Ndrive. This is not an official Ndrive python API, so some features may not be implemented, yet.

    from ndrive import Ndrive
    nd = Ndrive()
    nd.login("YOUR_ID","YOUR_PASSWORD")
    nd.uploadFile("test.txt",'/test.txt',True) # local_file, to_path, overwrite


Key Features
------------

* Download and upload a file
* Get file and directory list of Ndrive directories
* Make a url share link for a specific directory or file
* Search Ndrive file and  directory
* Get properties of file and directory


Installation
------------

This package is available in PyPI. To install it in your system, use easy_install::

    $ easy_install ndrive

Or use pip::

    $ pip install ndrive

Or check out developement version::

    $ git clone git://github.com/carpedm20/ndrive.git


Quick Start
-----------

If you want to start with Ndrive module, you need to *login* to Ndrive first. Just make a ``Ndrive`` object and use ``login`` method.

Login::

    nd = Ndrive()
    nd.login("YOUR_ID","YOUR_PASSWORD")


Then you might want to *download* a file from your Ndrive, but you might don't know exact filename in Ndrive directory. Then, you can use ``getList`` method to *get list* of files and directory of given directory.

*Don't forget to put / in front of the Ndrive path, which indicate root directory of Ndrive*

Get file and directory List::

    nd_list = nd.getList('/', type=3)
    print nd_list

If you find a file, then you can download the file to your local directory.

Download::

    nd.download('/Picture/flower.png', './flower.png')

Or you can upload a file::

    nd.puloadFile('./flower.png','/Picture/flower.png')

You can make a test directory at root directory::

    nd.makeDirectory('/test')

and move a file from root to a created test directory::

    nd.doMove('/flower.png','/test/flower.png')
